Let's break down each line of this assembly code:

1. `DATA_SEG SEGMENT`: Declares the start of a segment named `DATA_SEG` where data variables will be stored.

2. `PBCD DB 26H`: Declares a byte-sized variable named `PBCD` and initializes it with the value `26H` (which is 38 in decimal).

3. `DIG1 DB ?`: Declares a byte-sized variable named `DIG1` without initializing it (the `?` indicates an uninitialized variable).

4. `DIG2 DB ?`: Declares another byte-sized variable named `DIG2` without initializing it.

5. `DATA_SEG ENDS`: Declares the end of the `DATA_SEG` segment.

6. `CODE_SEG SEGMENT`: Declares the start of a segment named `CODE_SEG` where the actual code will be stored.

7. `ASSUME CS:CODE_SEG, DS:DATA_SEG`: Tells the assembler to assume that the code segment (`CS`) is `CODE_SEG` and the data segment (`DS`) is `DATA_SEG`.

8. `START: MOV AX, DATA_SEG`: Moves the starting address of the `DATA_SEG` segment to the `AX` register.

9. `MOV DS, AX`: Moves the contents of the `AX` register (which now holds the starting address of `DATA_SEG`) to the `DS` register, effectively initializing the `DS` register to point to the `DATA_SEG` segment.

10. `MOV AL, PBCD`: Moves the value of the `PBCD` variable (which is `26H` or 38) to the `AL` register.

11. `AND AL, 0FH`: Performs a bitwise AND operation between the value in `AL` and `0FH` (00001111 in binary), effectively isolating the lower 4 bits of `AL`.

12. `MOV DIG1, AL`: Moves the result of the AND operation (the lower 4 bits of `AL`) to the `DIG1` variable.

13. `MOV AL, PBCD`: Moves the value of the `PBCD` variable (which is still `26H` or 38) back to the `AL` register.

14. `AND AL, 0F0H`: Performs a bitwise AND operation between the value in `AL` and `0F0H` (11110000 in binary), effectively isolating the upper 4 bits of `AL`.

15. `MOV CL, 04H`: Moves the value `04H` (4 in decimal) to the `CL` register.

16. `ROL AL, CL`: Rotates the bits in `AL` to the left by the number of bits specified in `CL`, effectively shifting the upper 4 bits of `AL` to the lower 4 bits.

17. `MOV DIG2, AL`: Moves the result of the rotation (the upper 4 bits shifted to the lower 4 bits) to the `DIG2` variable.

18. `MOV AH, 4CH`: Sets up the DOS exit function.

19. `INT 21H`: Generates an interrupt to call the DOS function, effectively ending the program.

20. `CODE_SEG ENDS`: Declares the end of the `CODE_SEG` segment.

21. `END START`: Marks the end of the program, specifying that the program execution should start at the `START` label.
