Sure, I'll explain each line of the code you provided:

1. `DATA_SEG SEGMENT`: This declares the start of a segment named `DATA_SEG`, where data variables will be stored.

2. `NUM1 DB 26H`: This declares a byte-sized (DB) variable named `NUM1` and initializes it with the value `26H` (which is 38 in decimal).

3. `ONES_NUM DB 0H`: This declares another byte-sized variable named `ONES_NUM` and initializes it with the value `0H`.

4. `ZEROS_NUM DB 0H`: This declares another byte-sized variable named `ZEROS_NUM` and initializes it with the value `0H`.

5. `DATA_SEG ENDS`: This declares the end of the `DATA_SEG` segment.

6. `CODE_SEG SEGMENT`: This declares the start of a segment named `CODE_SEG`, where the actual code will be stored.

7. `ASSUME CS:CODE_SEG, DS:DATA_SEG`: This tells the assembler to assume that the code segment (`CS`) is `CODE_SEG` and the data segment (`DS`) is `DATA_SEG`.

8. `START: MOV AX, DATA_SEG`: This moves the starting address of the `DATA_SEG` segment to the `AX` register.

9. `MOV DS, AX`: This moves the contents of the `AX` register (which now holds the starting address of `DATA_SEG`) to the `DS` register, effectively initializing the `DS` register to point to the `DATA_SEG` segment.

10. `MOV AL, NUM1`: This moves the value of the `NUM1` variable (which is `26H` or 38) to the `AL` register.

11. `MOV CX, 8H`: This initializes the `CX` register to `8H` (which is 8 in decimal), presumably to set up a loop that will iterate 8 times.

12. `BACK: ROR AL, 1`: This rotates the bits of the `AL` register to the right by 1 bit.

13. `JC carry1`: This jumps to the `carry1` label if the last bit rotated out of the `AL` register is 1 (i.e., if there was a carry).

14. `INC ZEROS_NUM`: If there was no carry, this instruction increments the `ZEROS_NUM` variable, which is counting the number of zeros in the binary representation of `NUM1`.

15. `JMP EXIT`: This jumps to the `EXIT` label, which is outside the loop, effectively exiting the loop if there was no carry.

16. `carry1: INC ONES_NUM`: If there was a carry, this instruction increments the `ONES_NUM` variable, which is counting the number of ones in the binary representation of `NUM1`.

17. `EXIT: LOOP BACK`: This decrements the `CX` register and jumps back to the `BACK` label as long as `CX` is not zero, effectively looping 8 times.

18. `MOV AH, 4CH`: This sets up the DOS exit function.

19. `INT 21H`: This generates an interrupt to call the DOS function, effectively ending the program.

20. `CODE_SEG ENDS`: This declares the end of the `CODE_SEG` segment.

21. `END START`: This marks the end of the program, specifying that the program execution should start at the `START` label.
