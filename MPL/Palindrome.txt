This assembly code checks if a given string is a palindrome. Here's a breakdown of each line:

1. `DATA_SEG SEGMENT`: Declares the start of a segment named `DATA_SEG` where data variables will be stored.

2. `ARRY1 DB 'abcba'`: Declares a byte array named `ARRY1` and initializes it with the string `'abcba'`.

3. `LEN DW 5`: Declares a word-sized variable named `LEN` and initializes it with the value `5`, representing the length of the string.

4. `PALINDROME DB ?`: Declares a byte-sized variable named `PALINDROME` without initializing it, which will store the result (0 or 0FFH) indicating if the string is a palindrome.

5. `DATA_SEG ENDS`: Declares the end of the `DATA_SEG` segment.

6. `CODE_SEG SEGMENT`: Declares the start of a segment named `CODE_SEG` where the actual code will be stored.

7. `ASSUME CS:CODE_SEG, DS:DATA_SEG`: Tells the assembler to assume that the code segment (`CS`) is `CODE_SEG` and the data segment (`DS`) is `DATA_SEG`.

8. `START: MOV AX, DATA_SEG`: Moves the starting address of the `DATA_SEG` segment to the `AX` register.

9. `MOV DS, AX`: Moves the contents of the `AX` register (which now holds the starting address of `DATA_SEG`) to the `DS` register, effectively initializing the `DS` register to point to the `DATA_SEG` segment.

10. `MOV SI, OFFSET ARRY1`: Initializes the source index `SI` register with the offset of the `ARRY1` array, pointing to the start of the string.

11. `MOV DI, SI`: Initializes the destination index `DI` register with the value of `SI`, effectively pointing `DI` to the end of the string.

12. `MOV BX, LEN`: Moves the value of `LEN` (which is `5`) into the `BX` register, representing the length of the string.

13. `DEC BX`: Decrements `BX` to point `BX` to the last character of the string.

14. `ADD DI, BX`: Adds `BX` to `DI` to point `DI` to the last character of the string.

15. `AGAIN: MOV AL, [SI]`: Moves the byte at the memory location pointed to by `SI` (character at the start of the string) into the `AL` register.

16. `CMP AL, [DI]`: Compares the character at the start of the string (`AL`) with the character at the end of the string (`[DI]`).

17. `JNZ NO_PALI`: Jumps to `NO_PALI` label if the characters are not equal, indicating that the string is not a palindrome.

18. `INC SI`: Increments `SI` to move to the next character in the string.

19. `DEC DI`: Decrements `DI` to move to the previous character in the string.

20. `CMP SI, DI`: Compares `SI` with `DI` to check if all characters have been compared.

21. `JNC AGAIN`: Jumps to `AGAIN` label if `SI` is not greater than or equal to `DI`, indicating that there are more characters to compare.

22. `MOV PALINDROME, 0FFH`: If the loop completes without finding any non-matching characters, sets `PALINDROME` to `0FFH` to indicate that the string is a palindrome.

23. `JMP EXIT`: Jumps to the `EXIT` label to exit the program.

24. `NO_PALI: MOV PALINDROME, 00H`: If non-matching characters are found, sets `PALINDROME` to `00H` to indicate that the string is not a palindrome.

25. `EXIT: MOV AH, 4CH`: Sets up the DOS exit function.

26. `INT 21H`: Generates an interrupt to call the DOS function, effectively ending the program.

27. `CODE_SEG ENDS`: Declares the end of the `CODE_SEG` segment.

28. `END START`: Marks the end of the program, specifying that the program execution should start at the `START` label.
