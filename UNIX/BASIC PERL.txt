9a. Calculate area and perimeter of a square when the length of side is given. 

use strict; 
use warnings;  
print "Enter the length of the side of the square: "; 
my $side_length = <STDIN>; 
chomp($side_length); 
my $area = $side_length ** 2; 
my $perimeter = 4 * $side_length; 
print "Area of the square: $area\n"; 
print "Perimeter of the square: $perimeter\n"; 
9b. Create an array of names of local train stations from churchgate to Bandra. 
Display a station name when station number is given. Churchgate is No 1. 

use strict; 
use warnings; 
my @stations = ( 
"Churchgate",

my $station_number = <STDIN>;  
chomp($station_number); 
if ($station_number =~ /^\d+$/ && $station_number >= 1 && $station_number 
<= @stations) { 
my $station_name = $stations[$station_number - 1]; 
print "Station $station_number: $station_name\n"; 
} 
else { 
print "Invalid station number\n"; 
}
